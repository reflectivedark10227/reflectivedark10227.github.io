# SHADOW Project
Hi there, welcome to the SHADOW Project, a little idea turned website. I honestly don't know how I got here, but I don't need to either. If you really want to see me make this into something, I expect you to email me.
If not, well, I guess you don't want to see this become something then, huh?

Either way, this is the beginning of something interesting. What? I can't just chat away, I have to give you information? Well, here you go then. This site will eventually have:

- A full-scale book on it
- A blog, for fun
- other stuff

Yeah, Iâ€™m still figuring that one out. Come back soon.
